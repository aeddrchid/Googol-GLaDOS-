**Before you continue this simulator, watch this video [Googol GLaDOS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDhc4mKtMkU) (if you haven't already)**

   
> Please note, **everything you see is just animations**, **_nothing_** is actually being downloaded & installed onto your computer.

   
> You must wait before running the simulator because it will cache all the files needed to run smoothly.
   
> The simulator can also be run offline once the files are all cached.
(you will know this if the page has finished loading.)

   
> The simulator has been extensively **TESTED** on all major browsers. **Google Chrome is prefered.** 

> _(other browsers may vary, use at your own risk.)_
