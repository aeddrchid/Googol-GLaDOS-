Instructions:
-
From Alex I'Anson

+ Before you continue this simulator, watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDhc4mKtMkU 
  (if you haven't already)

+ Please note, everything you see is just animations, nothing is actually being downloaded & installed onto your computer.

+ Please wait for a bit because currently the audio files are being cached.

  (this is so the audio plays instantly when it loads so the animations doesn't become out of sync)

+ Also on the note of audio files, you need to click "allow" if you already haven't, otherwise,
the audio will not play The audio files are M4A and AAC encoded (Which will be changed), so you will need something like Quicktime to play (iTunes)
